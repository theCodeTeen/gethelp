## Backstory

During the delta wave in India, we all have seen people asking for essential supplies all over social media. The problem with this approach was help requests were floating freely all over internet, as a result it was really difficult for NGO's, Social workers, etc to find people in there region needing help.

Hence getHelp was created to solve problems like :

* Streamlining all the request on single platform
* Organising requests into graphical georegions
* Automatically delete requests older than 7 days
* Easy few step process for both i.e who need helps and who wants to help
